# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
I used next.js, on top of Reactjs and react-dom. I also used @chakra-ui/react for UI controls and some UI functionalities such as in-line styling. Then Typescript, Eslint with some predefined sets of rules.

### Q) What libraries did you add to the backend? What are they used for?
I used nestjs, which reminded me to Rails and creates components needed for clean architecture, it wrappers express.js. I also added Typescript, Eslint for linting, Jest for unit tests and some dependencies. 

### Q) Any other comments we should read before evaluating your solution?

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
I would have tested border cases in the backend.
Frontend has no tests at all. Frontend should be simplified and reorganized.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
I should say the architecture in the Backend. However, since I am a backend dev, I have not many opportunities for creating a front end project from scratch. So I'm proud of it.
I learned lots about React this week. Many things can be changed. I wouldn't go for next.js for this exercise as it is not intended for production, so I would have worked on react and MUI directly.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
Frontend, mainly understanding component props, reading an external resource on component load and also with toggle controls.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
Frontend and Backend could be two different challenges. Candidates could have challenges needed for their role.
In fact, there could be a series of mini assignments. Such as only backend, web3, and so on.
